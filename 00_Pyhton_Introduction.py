###################################### Introduction And Queations #############################################

# 1) What is Python? What are the benefits of using Python?

# Python is a programming language with objects, modules, threads, exceptions and automatic memory management.
# The benefits of pythons are that it is simple and easy, portable, extensible, 
# build-in data structure and it is an open source.

###############################################################################################################

# 2) What is PEP 8?

# PEP 8 is a coding convention, a set of recommendation, about how to write your Python code more readable.

###############################################################################################################

# 3) What is pickling and unpickling?

# Pickle module accepts any Python object and converts it into a string representation and 
# dumps it into a file by using dump function, this process is called pickling. 
# While the process of retrieving original Python objects from the stored string representation is called unpickling.

###############################################################################################################

# 4) How Python is interpreted?

# Python language is an interpreted language. Python program runs directly from the source code.
# It converts the source code that is written by the programmer into an intermediate language, 
# which is again translated into machine language that has to be executed.

###############################################################################################################

# 5) How memory is managed in Python?

# Python memory is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap.
# The programmer does not have an access to this private heap and interpreter takes care of this Python private heap.
# The allocation of Python heap space for Python objects is done by Python memory manager. 
# The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.
# Python also have an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycle all the unused memory and 
# frees the memory and makes it available to the heap space.

###############################################################################################################

# 6) What are the tools that help to find bugs or perform static analysis?

# PyChecker is a static analysis tool that detects the bugs in Python source code and warns about the style and complexity of the bug.
# Pylint is another tool that verifies whether the module meets the coding standard.

###############################################################################################################

# 7) What are Python decorators?

# A Python decorator is a specific change that we make in Python syntax to alter functions easily.

###############################################################################################################

# 8) What is the difference between list and tuple?

# The difference between list and tuple is that list is mutable while tuple is not.
# Tuple can be hashed for e.g as a key for dictionaries.

###############################################################################################################

# 9) How are arguments passed by value or by reference?

# Everything in Python is an object and all variables hold references to the objects.
#  The references values are according to the functions; as a result you cannot change the value of the references. 
#  However, you can change the objects if it is mutable.

# Web developers obviously need strong technical abilities. But when hiring a web developer, candidates’ soft skills can be just as important as their tech prowess.

# During a time when many IT professionals are working at home, abilities like communicating clearly and tactfully with colleagues within or outside of the department who are also remote can determine whether someone flourishes or flounders on the job.

# To avoid the high costs of a bad hire, you may want to reexamine how you vet job candidates. Here are 16 of the best web developer interview questions, the first 10 of which relate to soft skills.

# 1. Can you tell me briefly about some projects you’ve worked on and the approach you took from start to finish?
# Web developer interview questions like these will help you learn about the candidate’s work style — how they gather requirements, solve problems, manage user feedback, handle QA and collaborate in a team setting. You’ll also gain insight into whether they pay close attention to user experience.

# 2. Pretend I’m a tech novice. Can you explain what __ is in plain English?
# Your newly hired web developer will likely work closely with other departments, which means they’ll need to interact effectively with their non-techie colleagues in marketing, sales, corporate communications, and other areas of the company. Ask candidates to expound on a topic all web developers should be familiar with, and look for their ability to communicate in non-jargony terms. Here are some concepts to choose from:

# MVC model
# Responsive design
# AWS/Azure
# APIs
# Microservice architecture
# You could also ask them to compare and contrast related terms, such as UI vs. UX or front end vs. back end, for a lay audience.

# 3. Have you ever given a presentation?
# IT plays a strategic role in many companies, so public speaking is a good skill to have in a web developer. You’ll want to hire a web developer who is comfortable presenting. Bonus points to those who’ve given presentations to large non-IT groups. Follow up with questions on how they gathered and organized information, and what they did to keep the audience’s attention. 


# 4. Who is your role model in the world of tech?
# Do they admire innovators? Talented engineers? Great designers? Entrepreneurs who’ve made billions? People who do good in the world? The answer to this question can tell you much about a candidate’s ambitions and values, helping you decide whether they’d be a good or poor fit for your company culture.

# 5. Name a website or app that annoys you. What’s wrong with it?
# This web developer interview question asks about the candidate’s awareness of current issues in web development, as well as their own problem-solving abilities. A good answer is one where they do more than just gripe about someone else’s work. Skilled web developers will offer real solutions to practical issues, such as how to improve load times or optimize the user experience.

# 6. What do you do when an application stops working?
# Problem solving is at the heart of web development, so listen to how candidates talk about fixing things that go awry. Do they break down the situation and analyze potential causes? Do they know when to ask for help and where to go to find answers? How do they respond if their first idea for a solution doesn’t pan out? 

# 7. Tell me about a time you’ve had to respond to negative feedback.
# Web developers have to deal with a barrage of comments from beta testers and actual users. The ideal candidate for this position needs to know how to take that feedback, analyze it and turn it into action. Listen to how they walk through the issue and arrive at a conclusion.

# 8. Have you ever been blamed for something that wasn’t your fault?
# This is a challenging question, but it’s a good way of gauging the candidate’s attitude toward teamwork. If an interviewee is quick to throw colleagues under the bus, that’s a red flag. You want to hire a diplomatic web developer who doesn’t get frustrated quickly and who will work toward a solution.

# 9. What are the biggest challenges of working on the front end of an application?
# Web developers work closely with the rest of the development team. They need to understand how data is structured, what functions are available, how APIs are called, and how web services are configured. Candidates should be able to discuss the entire development lifecycle, and show an understanding of where they fit in. This question will help to differentiate between a web developer and a web designer who knows a little Java.

# 10. Tell me about the projects you’re working on (or have worked on) in your spare time?
# Technology moves fast. When hiring a web developer, you’re looking for someone who invests some of their own time in growing their skills and staying on top of emerging trends. Candidates should be able to discuss some personal projects, either past or present, and possibly even show you their work.

# 11. What APIs have you worked with?
# All candidates should have worked with APIs for well-known commercial services, such as those offered by Twitter, Slack, Dropbox, and the suite of APIs offered by Google. Candidates should be able to talk about how to call API functions and integrate results into their design. Advanced candidates may have helped to develop and document their own APIs, and they will be able to talk about how they worked with the development team to create secure, useful interfaces.

# 12. What do you think will be the biggest trends in future web development?
# This is an open-ended question, and candidates may talk about technologies like Motion UI, AI-powered customer service chatbots, voice search, Google’s improvements to their Accelerated Mobile Pages technology, emerging cybersecurity threats, or advanced analytics techniques. Whatever they focus on, ask them how they think this will improve user experience, what challenges the technology presents, and how they think they might integrate the new technology with their current work.

# 13. Which content management systems have you worked with?
# Some of the most popular CMSs are WordPress, Joomla and Drupal, all of which are open-source systems written in PHP and based on a relational database like MySQL. To elicit more information, ask interviewees if they’re involved in the relevant open-source communities and whether they’ve ever made any contributions. 

# 14. How are your SQL skills?
# Web developers may not interact directly with a database, but it’s important that they understand how data is structured. Any practical SQL experience, such as having worked as a database administrator, is highly valuable. 

# 15. What’s the biggest difference between developing for mobile and desktop?
# Most people browse on mobile, but the majority of development work happens on a desktop. A suitable candidate should know how to develop for both, and they should be able to sound off on crucial differences, such as screen size, touch input, limited multitasking, and variation in browser plug-ins. They should also understand how to create a great user experience on any platform.

# 16. Can you find the error in this code?
# It’s common practice to ask candidates to write code by hand during an interview, which isn’t an ideal setting. An alternative is to print out a piece of code — such as a Java class and the JavaScript that invokes it — with strategically placed errors and ask interviewees to debug it. This is a quick way to establish both technical knowledge and their attention to detail.

# Asking these 16 web developer interview questions should help you narrow down your list of candidates to those with not only the best technical skills but also strong interpersonal qualities. Having both has been a great way to get ahead for IT web developers in recent years.

# Here is a simple programming challenge. Could you have a go at solving it?

# Example question 1 (shorter time frame): Write a function to compute the Nth Fibonacci number.

# Example question 2 (longer time frame): Write a function that takes the current position of a knight on a chessboard, and returns a preliminary list of possible moves the knight could make. (That is, the current positions of other pieces are not provided, so you can’t check against capturing pieces on the knight’s own side nor making their king vulnerable to capture.)

# Hide answer
# Giving candidates a simple programming challenge may seem trivial, but it’s useful for several reasons:

# It gives you an opportunity to see how well they work under pressure. (It’s important to have them do this in front of you—you need to hire people who can write code under stress when needed!)
# It demonstrates their educational foundation.
# It shows simply whether they can write code or not, and how experienced they are.
# Depending on what kind of challenge you choose, it can help you differentiate skill sets. It also helps tease out their scientific/mathematical background and whether they are a high-level thinker.
# What programming languages do you use? Which three do you prefer, or are most familiar with?

# Hide answer
# This question will give you an idea of the candidate’s programming knowledge, their level of proficiency, and whether they are a good fit for your company.

# GitHub, a code-sharing website used by developers from around the world, listed the following as ten of the most commonly used programming languages and technologies at the end of 2017:

# JavaScript is a dynamic language typically used for adding interactivity on websites.
# Python is a powerful, general purpose language that gained extensive popularity in 2018. It’s widely used for a range of tasks, including web development, machine learning, and data analysis.
# Java (unrelated to JavaScript) is a versatile general-purpose programming language used to create cross-platform applications.
# Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented, general purpose open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It’s primarily used for web applications, in particular via the Rails server-side MVC framework.
# PHP is an open-source, server-side scripting language used for the development of web applications.
# C++ is an object-oriented programming language typically used for operating systems, games, and embedded software. It can also be used for building higher-level systems such as remote-device and network management applications.
# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a mainstay of the web and used for formatting web page content. CSS files help define critical aspects (font, color, layout sizes, spacing, etc.) as well as maintain a continuous look and feel throughout multiple pages of a website.
# C# is an object-oriented language developed by Microsoft. It is designed for improving productivity in web development and is often used with XML-based web services on the .NET platform.
# Go is an open-source programming language made for building large-scale, complex software infrastructure. It can also be transpiled into JavaScript for use in front-end web development, although this is a less common scenario at the moment.
# C is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Originally developed for writing system software, nowadays it’s often used for developing firmware or portable applications.
# What do you think are the most important aspects to pay attention to when reviewing another team member’s code?

# Hide answer
# Code reviews are fundamental to the software development process, even when there’s only one engineer. By posing this question you’ll get an idea of the candidate’s knowledge and problem-solving skills, their attention to detail, and whether they can keep an overview of the project.

# Here is a sample answer:

# “I first look for security, functionality, and readability. Is the code simple, or cluttered, bloated, and inefficient? How many lines of unnecessary code will I need to re-write or remove? I check for any weaknesses that could cause vulnerabilities and confirm that regulatory requirements have been met.”

# Everyone has their own coding style and every developer or team will have requirements that are specific to their codebase. Effective code reviews often have checklists. Below is a limited list of general suggestions you could consider including:

# The software passes automated and manual testing
# Code follows applicable conventions and is easy to understand
# Code is not duplicated
# No negatively named boolean variables
# Scrutinize methods with boolean parameters
# Blocks of code inside loops are as small as possible
# No memory leaks
# But more important than which exact points a candidate brings up is their reasoning for doing so. Be wary of candidates who get stuck on tabs-versus-spaces bikeshedding at the expense of more crucial engineering elements: The above items shouldn’t all carry the same weight.

# Do you consider unit testing essential, or a waste of time?

# Hide answer
# Every engineer/developer worth considering should be familiar with unit testing. Asking this question will give you an understanding of their attitude toward it, and what level of priority they give it in their working process. Do they follow test-driven development (TDD) or behavior-driven development (BDD), or are unit tests something they tack on afterward for the sake of process conformance or mere appearances?

# Typically regarded by most industry professionals as being a best practice in code maintenance and software development, unit tests are usually part of an overall testing strategy. They test for logic errors and coding flaws, helping to prevent bugs from advancing to the finished product. Plus, because they’re automated, they prevent regressions, where bugs return that had already been fixed.

# What has your experience been like as part of an agile software development process, if any?

# Hide answer
# The Manifesto for Agile Software Development outlines an approach based on iterations rather than a waterfall model. Requirements and solutions are generated through the collaboration of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their end users. Among other things, it encourages a flexible planning style and a rapid response to change.

# Knowing how a developer feels about agile development can help you understand how they will fit into your own process. Open-minded developers that are also able to see flaws in how agile processes have been run can provide valuable feedback to help your team’s methodology grow and evolve.

# On the other hand, if they’re dead-set against a core process of yours, there may end up being too much friction for them to stay productive.

# How familiar are you with object-oriented programming (OOP)?

# Hide answer
# OOP has been a standard convention for over 20 years and is organized around objects rather than actions, and data rather than logic. It is ever-present and it is very unlikely a candidate would not have run into it at some point.

# Here are ten examples of terms they should be able to define:

# class, object (and the difference between the two)
# method (as opposed to, say, a C function)
# virtual method, pure virtual method
# class/static method
# static/class initializer
# constructor
# destructor/finalizer
# superclass or base class
# subclass or derived class
# NB. Some firms avoid OOP and prefer to use a functional programming (FP) language such as Clojure.

# Please explain big-O notation in the simplest terms.

# Hide answer
# Big-O notation (Landau’s symbol) is used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It describes how the runtime or space requirement of a function grows as the input grows.

# Two functions with the same Big-O notation will tend to have the same growth rate and thus have the same relative performance with large inputs.

# For example, the bubble sort algorithm has an average time complexity of O(n^2) while merge sort and heap sort both have an average complexity of O(n log n). In average cases, merge sort and heap sort will demonstrate similar performance while they will both outperform bubble sort.

# Candidates should be able to demonstrate a basic understanding of the fundamentals of big-O algorithmic complexity analysis.

# They should know that algorithms usually fall into the following performance classes:

# Constant-time
# Logarithmic
# Linear
# Polynomial
# Exponential
# Factorial
# They should also be able to explain why a given operation falls into a particular complexity class
